## 🧩 Short Description

**PokéDesktop** is a “pet-desktop” style application built with **Godot 4.5 (C#)** that brings your Pokémon team to life on your computer desktop.  
Using your game save (compatible up to **Pokémon Scarlet/Violet**), your Pokémon walk across your taskbar, express emotions, and can even gift you random items or money. Interacting with them increases their friendship and strengthens your bond!

## <a name="features"></a>✨ Features

### <a name="languages"></a>Languages
**French** and **English** are currently supported.

### <a name="movements"></a>Movements
By default, Pokémon use one of several available smart movement systems depending on their type or behavior:

* Walk – Standard ground movement (default)
* Fly / Swim – The Pokémon hovers or floats (e.g. Rayquaza, Gyarados)
* Teleport – The Pokémon teleports from place to place (e.g. Abra)
* Bounce – The Pokémon walks and bounces (e.g. Spoink, Grumpig)
* Dig – For ground-dwelling Pokémon (e.g. Diglett)

You can disable smart movement entirely to make all Pokémon use simple walking instead.

### <a name="sounds"></a>Sounds
Pokémon can emit their cries when an emotion appears or when you click on them. These triggers are configurable.

### <a name="show-player-party-pokémon"></a>Show Player Party Pokémon
Displays the Pokémon from the player's current save file directly on the desktop/taskbar. (Between 1 to 6 Pokémon)

### <a name="emotions-system"></a>Emotions System
Pokémon periodically display emotions based on their friendship level.  

| Image | Emotion | Friendship Range | Description |
|----|----------|------------------|--------------|
| ![Angry emotion](/assets/images/emotions/angry/angry_3.png) | 😠 **Angry** | 0–49 | Upset Pokémon |
| ![Depressed emotion](/assets/images/emotions/depressed/depressed_3.png) | 😞 **Depressed** | 50–99 | Sad or unmotivated |

| ![Happy emotion](/assets/images/emotions/happy/happy_3.png) | 😊 **Happy** | 150–199 | Cheerful and playful |
| ![Love emotion](/assets/images/emotions/love/love_3.png) | 💖 **Love** | 200–255 (max) | Maximum friendship and affection |
| ![Sleep emotion](/assets/images/emotions/sleep/sleep_3.png) | 💤 **Sleep** | Random | Occasionally takes a nap |
| ![Angry emotion](/assets/images/emotions/gift/gift_2.png) | 🎁 **Gift (Lucky)** | Random | Gives a random item or money |

### <a name="improve-friendship"></a>Improve Friendship
Clicking on a Pokémon emotion increases its friendship by **+3**.

### <a name="drop-system"></a>Drop System
Clicking while gift emotion is played will also trigger a **drop** event:
- +5 friendship boost  
- Random loot (item or money)
	- Money is between 200 and 2000
	- Item can be TMHMs, Items, Medicine, Balls, Candy, BattleItems, Berries or Ingredients between 1 and 3

### <a name="images"></a>🖼️ Images
